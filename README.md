I thought we'd need the Crunch software to optimize texture loading in Logic World, hence this repo. However, I've ended up optimizing it in a different way: texture loading is now done dynamically, where individual textures aren't actually loaded until they are needed. I think this is better because it allows us to keep the texture files in a more accessible file format that dds.

I'm not deleting this repo, however, because we might need Crunch for something else in the future.
